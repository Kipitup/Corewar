# Corewar

*The Corewar project is the final exercice from the Algorithm branch at 42.
Core War is a programming game in which several programs battle for domination in a virtual computer using a limited set of instructions.
Students must build the arena, develop a champion and an interpreter to convert it into a binary.
This project is relatively straight-forward but requires a complete reading of the documentation and a precise implementation.*


Usage: ./corewar -visu [(-dump32 | -dump64) n_cycles] [(-n num) champ1.cor] ...

Usage: ./asm mychampion.s
